[verse 1]
G       Em
Down on King St.
Bm                          G
Kelly's getting dark at the pharmacy
Em              Bm   
Who know's when he'll come home 
  G      D
tonight


Em           Bm
Hot breath, Toronto
          G             Bm
Let's get lost again underneath the glow
G             Bm
High heels hopscotch the streetcar
G      D
lines

[pre-chorus]
          Em
Hear the delay decaying
Bm
Text threads fraying
Am
Home feels so far away
        B
And it makes me

---
[chorus]
Am 
Down for getting dark
Bm7
Cause the dark gets me
Am
And all the other lovers 
Bm7           Em
Make it so heavy
Am
Takes a little emptiness 
Bm7
To feel complete
Am  
When crowds come ever thicker
Bm7                 Em
And liquor it comes free
