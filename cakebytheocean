James:

Oh no
See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, girl; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tip toe, tip toe

Ah!
Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh!)
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me (ah)
You're a real life fantasy, you're a real life fantasy (huh!)
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously

Both:

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)

Jenn:

God damn
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm begging, "Yes, ma'am."
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh

Both:

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece (huh!)
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me (ah)
You're a real life fantasy, you're a real life fantasy (huh!)
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously
Whoa

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean


Jenn: Oh ah
James: Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Jenn: Oh ah
James: Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)

James: 

You're fucking delicious

Talk to me, girl

Jenn: Talk to me, baby

Both: 

I'm going blind from this sweet, sweet craving, whoa
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Walk for me, baby (James: walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)

Both: 

Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready; I need it every night
Jenn: Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
James: Ah ya ya ya ya I 
Both: keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (huh)
